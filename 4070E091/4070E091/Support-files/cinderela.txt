Once upon a time there lived a girl called Cinderella. she was happy live with her father and mother. until her mother
died dead and her father had married a widow with two daughters. Her stepmother didn’t like her one little bit. But, for
the poor unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. Her stepmother has two daughters and they were very bossy. No rest and no
comfort. She had to work hard all day. Only when evening came was she allowed to sit for a while by the fire, near the
cinders. That’s why everybody called her Cinderella.
Cinderella used to spend long hours all alone talking to the cat. The cat always said, “Miaow“, which really meant, “Cheer
up! You have something neither of your stepsisters has and that is beauty.” It was quite true. Cinderella, even dressed in
old rags, was a lovely girl. While her stepsisters, no matter how splendid and elegant their clothes, were still clumsy,
lumpy and ugly and always would be. One day, beautiful new dresses arrived at the house. A ball was to be held at the
palace and the stepsisters were getting ready to go. Cinderella didn’t even dare ask if she could go too. She knew very
well what the answer would be: “You? You’re staying at home to wash the dishes, scrub the floors and turn down the beds
for your stepsisters.” They will come home tired and very sleepy. Cinderella sighed, “Oh dear, I’m so unhappy!” and the
cat murmured “Miaow.”
