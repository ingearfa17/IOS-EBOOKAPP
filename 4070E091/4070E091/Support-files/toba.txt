Once upon a time there was a prosperous village in a far away island called Sumatra. In northern part of the island, lived
a farmer whose name was Toba. He lived alone in a hut by a small forest. He worked on his farmland to grow rice and
vegetables that he sells to local market. Once day he wanted to catch some fish so he went to a river and fished there. He
was very surprised when he got a big fish. The fish was as big as human being. Soon he went home and put the fish in his
kitchen. He planned to cook the fish for his dinner that night. When he got to his house that afternoon he took a bath.
Then as he walked into his bedroom after taking a bath Toba was very shocked. Do you want to know what happened?
There stood in his living room a very beautiful girl. The girl greeted him nicely. For a moment Toba was speechless. When
he could control his emotion he asked her.
‘Who are you? What’s your name? Why suddenly you are here in my house?’
‘Pardon me if I surprised you Mr. Toba, but you took me here. I was the fish that you caught in the river. Now that I
become a human being again, I would like to thank you and I will be your servant to express my thankfulness’
