Long time ago in West Java, lived a beautiful girl named Dayang Sumbi. She was also smart and clever. Her beauty and
intelligence made a prince from the heavenly kingdom of Kahyangan desire her as his wife. The prince asked permission from
his father to marry Dayang Sumbi. People from Kahyangan could never live side by side with humans, but his father approved
on one condition, when they had a child, the prince would transform into a dog. The prince accepted the condition.
They get married and lived happily in the woods until Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy. The prince then changed into
a dog named Tumang. Their son is named Sangkuriang. He was very smart and handsome like his father. Everyday, he hunted
animals and looked for fruits to eat. One day, when he was hunting, Sangkuriang accidentally killed Tumang. His arrow
missed the deer he was targeting and hit Tumang instead. He went home and tells her mother about the dog. “What?” Dayang
Sumbi was appalled. Driven by sadness and anger, she grabbed a weaving tool and hit Sangkuriang’s head with it. Dayang
Sumbi was so sad; she didn’t pay any attention to Sangkuriang and started to cry.
